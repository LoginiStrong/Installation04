1. The reason this program uses abstract classes is because 
each type of bird has to have certain methods that cross over
all instances of object type birds. 
2. Sometimes we still don't want to use protected because
protected variables are shared among all classes, just not
the main. So the unauthorized modification of variables
could happen.
3. What inheretance does is allow a parent class to extend its 
methods to a child class. The child class can then use all the 
parent classes methods.
4. If we don't override all the abstract methods java will
throw an error, because the inheriting class must define the 
abstract methods.
