The big three are the Destructor, Copy Constructor, and the operator=.The default destructor applies it to every data
member, the default copy coonstructor applying itself to each data member in turn, the default operator= by applying
itself to each data member in turn. Defaults are unnacceptable when dealing with a data member that is a pointer and the pointee is heap-allocated 
by some object member function.

4.10
Copying can be disabled by placing the copy cconstructor or operator= declarations in the private section of the class.

4.13
C++ seperates the class specification from its implementation. 

4.14
The idiom is a declaration we use so that a class declaration can not be repeated in a single .cpp file.

4.15
Static members are declared inside a class declaration beside the member vairiable or function. THey work almost 
identically as they do in java.

4.18
An incomplete class declaration is when you instantiate the class name and put nothing inside of it.
This is done because when we use two classes inside of one another there defintions are seperated and it will generate
an error, so we temporarily incompletely define them.
