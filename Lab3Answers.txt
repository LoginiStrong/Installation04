1. We can't use the == operator on objects
because that operator is comparing the addresses of each
object, rather than the entities the objects hold
2. To make .equals work when comparing an object the programmer has
to overide the original .equals method with their own. This new method
works by checking the instance of each object and comparing the entities 
within the objects.
3. Static methods can only reference static variables.
4. A static variable is defined in one class and then carried over all the instances of related classes. 
A non static variable has to be reinstantiated every time it's referenced in a different class.
