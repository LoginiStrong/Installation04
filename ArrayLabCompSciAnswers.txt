1. A good reason to use th arraylist rather than a traditional array when adding or removing things 
is because with a regular array you have to recreate the entire array, while the arraylist does it for you.
2. clone(), isEmpty(), and iterator()
3.A do while loop is more practical for a couple reasons, on is that the menu is located inside the loop and
has to be shown to the user before an input. The other is that the user needs to perform the input at least once
(hence the do part of the while loop).
