What is linear probing?: Linear probing is a technique in programming that we use when dealing with hash tables. Specifically,
it is when we arrive at a collision in the table so we move down the table untill we have found an empty space where we can put our element.

How does a splay tree work? That is, explain what splaying is and when it is called?: A splay tree works by having the basic foundation of
a BST, but it has quick access to prevoius elements in the tree. When an element is looked up in the tree it is moved to the root without
disobeying BST. It does this through three rotations. Simple rotation, Zig-Zig or Zag-Zag, and Zig-Zag. It also balances the train this way.

What is the average complexity of m operations on a splay tree?: O(log(n))

What is the guarantee of an AVL tree?: The difference between the depth of right and left sub-trees cannot be more than one.

What does the AVL tree after inserting the following nodes look like?: 3,6,4,7,8,5
						
											6
									4				7
								3		5				8
