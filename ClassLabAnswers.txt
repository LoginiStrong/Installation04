1. The problem with making the temperature variable public would mean
that its contents could be modified between the main and the class,
therefore the varibale could be messed with and illegitimize an output

2. I created a method within the class that checked if the degree was
in bounds, and then called that method when needed rather than rewriting the code

3. The first object changed because it was set to be equal to the second object,
meaning that when second object is called to change, the first will do the same.
