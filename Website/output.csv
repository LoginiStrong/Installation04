By Sur La Table &amp; Andrews McMeel Publishing,Home /Recipes/Appetizers/Dips, Spreads, Sauces &amp; Seasonings/Apricot-Bourbon Mustard/,Apricot-Bourbon Mustard,Makes 2&#8532; cups,⅔ cup yellow mustard seeds 1 cup bourbon such as Maker&#8217;s Mark ⅔ cup water ⅔ cup packed chopped dried apricots 4 tablespoons cider vinegar 4 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon kosher or sea salt ,Do you have a Dagwood-style sandwich maker on your gift list one of those friends or a family member who loves nothing more than raiding the refrigerator and making a mile-high sandwich layered with meats and cheese and smeared with mayonnaise and mustard? This is the perfect gift-a unique homemade mustard blending the sweetness of dried apricots steeped in bourbon with the bright bite of whole mustard seeds.Put the mustard seeds in a medium bowl and pour in 2/3 cup of the bourbon and all the water. Soak the mustard seeds overnight or for up to 24 hours.At least 1 hour before you plan to make the mustard put the apricots in a bowl and pour in the remaining 1/3 cup bourbon. Macerate the apricots until most of the bourbon is absorbed (the apricots need to soak for a minimum of 1 hour or you can start soaking them at the same time you prepare the mustard seeds).Before making the mustard wash the jars and lids in hot soapy water and dry thoroughly. Alternatively run the jars through the regular cycle of your dishwasher.To make the mustard first strain the mustard seeds reserving the soaking liquid. Set aside the mustard seeds.In a food processor fitted with the metal blade combine the apricots any unabsorbed bourbon remaining in the bowl cider vinegar honey and salt. Pur&eacute;e until almost smooth. Add the mustard seed soaking liquid and continue to pur&eacute;e until smooth. Add the mustard seeds and process until about half of the seeds are cracked and the others are incorporated but still whole.Evenly divide the mustard among the prepared condiment jars leaving ½ inch headspace. Wipe the rims clean and secure the lids. Label and refrigerate for at least 2 weeks to allow the flavors to develop and mature.
By Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,Home /Recipes/Side Dishes/Vegetables/Sous Vide Asparagus/,Sous Vide Asparagus,Makes 4 servings,1 pound asparagus 1 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 (gallon) Ziploc bags ,The color and flavor of cooking vegetables using sous-vide technology is unparalleled to standard cooking methods. Sous vide cooking allows us to cook at a temperature a bit below the boiling point of water so there is less risk of under/overcooking your vegetables. Furthermore sealing the vegetables before cooking in a water bath helps retain the natural plant sugars which would otherwise be diluted into a large volume of cooking water. That means brighter color and fuller flavor every time.When we tested cooking asparagus in the Sansaire circulator we discovered that the vegetables contained more liquid and fibrous properties than proteins and therefore floated. Additionally when we compared cooking the asparagus lying flat in a bag with asparagus bunched at the bottom of the bag the asparagus which was cooked lying flat yield better color and flavor.Sous-vide cooking times may vary based on the device being used. Please consult your device's owner's manual for proper food-handling and safety procedures.  Choose a container large enough to hold your food with plenty of room for the water to circulate. Attach the Sansaire to the side of the container using the clamp and add water until the level is above the minimum fill line but below the maximum fill line. Remember that the water level will rise when you add your food. Plug in and turn on your immersion circulator to 132 degrees. Wait until the target water temperature has been achieved before starting to cook.Using a vegetable peeler peel the asparagus from the tip towards the base. Line up the asparagus on a cutting board with the bottom of the Ziploc bag as your guide to how long your asparagus should be cut. Using a sharp knife carefully cut the asparagus so that the lengths are about the same size as the bag to enable the asparagus to snuggly fit into the bag. Season the vegetables lightly with oil salt and pepper. Place the asparagus into the Ziploc bag so that the bottom of the asparagus is flat within the bag. With the top of the Ziploc bag open carefully submerge the bag into the bottom of the water bath without allowing any water into the bag itself. The pressure of the water circulating around the outside of the bag will push any air out of the bag and form a seal around the vegetables. Using the side of the water container carefully seal the bag and leave the asparagus to circulate in the water until the vegetables are tender about 40 minutes.To serve: Using tongs carefully remove the asparagus from the Ziploc bag into a warmed platter and serve immediately.
