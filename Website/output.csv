By Tested and perfected in the Sur La Table kitchen,Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Grains, Legumes &amp; Pasta/SPINACH TAGLIATELLE/,SPINACH TAGLIATELLE,Not specified,3 ounces spinach washed and trimmed 1/2 teaspoon fine kosher salt plus more for salting water 1 large egg 1 large egg yolk 1 1/4 cups (6 1/4 ounces) all-purpose flour plus more for dusting Semolina flour for dusting pasta and surfaces  ,Tagliatelle pappardelle tagliolini are just a few of our favorite hand-cut ribbon pasta. The only difference between the shapes is the width in which it is cut. Tagliatelle meaning “cut” in Italian is cut to 1/3-inch pappardelle to 3/4-inch and tagliolini to 1/8-inch. The general rule of thumb for the sauce is the wider the ribbon the heavier the sauce. 1. To blanch spinach:   Fill a large pot of water and bring to a rolling boil. Generously salt water. Add spinach to boiling water and cook until tender about 30 seconds. Using tongs transfer spinach to a colander and rinse under cold water. Thoroughly spin dry spinach in a salad spinner or wring dry in a clean kitchen towel.2. To prepare dough: To the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade purée spinach. Add eggs and yolk to purée and process until well combined. Add flour and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and process until dough comes together about 20 seconds.3. Transfer dough to well-floured surface. Knead dough until it is smooth and flexible but not sticky adding small amounts of flour as needed 6 to 8 minutes. Gather dough into a ball and flatten into a disk. Cover in plastic wrap and allow dough to rest for at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour at room temperature.4. To roll out and cut dough:  Secure a pasta machine to edge of a long countertop. Using a bench scraper cut dough into 2 pieces. Keep extra dough covered in plastic wrap while working with one piece. With a rolling pin or your hand roll or flatten dough into a rough rectangle that will fit inside widest setting of pasta machine. Roll dough through machine catching it with one hand as you roll with other. Take dough and trifold it like a letter. Turn dough so one open end faces machine and roll it through on widest setting again. Fold turn and roll once more on the widest setting. 5. Continue rolling pasta through machine without folding adjusting rollers to a smaller setting each time. Roll out each sheet to second to last thinnest setting. If pasta sheet becomes too large to handle use a bench scraper to cut it into more manageable lengths and continue rolling. 6. To shape the tagliatelle:  Liberally flour one sheet of pasta and loosely roll it into a cylinder. Using a sharp knife cut roll into 1/3" ribbons. Unwrap ribbons toss them with semolina flour and form into piles on baking sheets dusted with semolina. The pasta can be cooked immediately or covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use. 7. To cook the pasta: To a large pot of water set over high heat add water to 2/3 full and bring to a boil. Generously season water with salt. Add pasta and stir immediately to prevent tagliatelle from sticking together. Boil until al dente 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain pasta through a colander. Use reserved pasta water to thin your chosen pasta sauce.

Although nearly any frosting pairs well with this celebration favorite it is especially luscious filled and frosted with silken chocolate ganache for the two-toned birthday cake most of us remember from childhood. For a special party or tea make the mini cupcakes variation at the end of the recipe (shown at left) then top them with swirls of Cream Cheese Frosting and finish them with pretty Sugared Flowers and/or touches of gold leaf.Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and position an oven rack in the center. Lightly coat the pan with melted butter oil or high-heat canola-oil spray and fit it with a round of parchment paper.Cream the butter with the sugar: Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer and beat on medium until very light&#45;almost white&#45;in color 4 to 5 minutes. You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl although you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Scrape down the bowl with the spatula.Add the eggs: Beat the eggs and vanilla in the small bowl to blend. With the mixer on medium add the eggs to the butter mixture about 1 tablespoon at a time allowing each addition to completely blend in before adding the next. About halfway through turn off the mixer and scrape down the bowl then resume adding the eggs. Scrape down the bowl again.Add the dry and wet ingredients alternately: With the fine-mesh strainer sift the cake flour baking soda and salt into the medium bowl and whisk together. With the mixer on the lowest speed add the flour mixture and the sour cream alternately beginning with one-third of the flour mixture and half the sour cream; repeat then finish with flour mixture.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer to a rack to cool completely.Unmold the cake: Run the thin and flexible knife or spatula around the edge of the pan to loosen the cake. Place the cardboard on top of the pan hold both together and flip over. Remove the pan leaving the parchment on the cake. Flip again onto a second cake cardboard (or a plate) so the cake is right side up. Level the cake if necessary. Using a serrated knife slice the cake horizontally into two layers.Assemble and frost the cake: Place the cake cardboard (or plate) on your work surface. Flip the top layer of cake over and place it cut side up on thecardboard&#45;this will be the bottom of the cake. With the icing spatula spread 1 cup of ganache evenly over the surface of the cake all the way to the edge. Flip the bottom layer and slide it cut side down into place on top of the ganache. Peel off the parchment paper. Voil&agrave;&#45;a crumb-free surface for frosting. Spread a very thin layer of the frosting known as a crumb coat over the cake. Chill for 15 minutes just to set the crumb coat. Use the remaining ganache to frost the top and side of the cake. Use a spoon to create swirls all over the top by gently pressing the tip of the spoon rounded edge down into the frosting in a back-and-forth motion.

By Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,Home /Recipes/Main Courses/Seafood/Seared Salmon With Saffron Hollandaise/,Seared Salmon With Saffron Hollandaise,Not specified,4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets pin bones removed Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon vegetable oil ,To prepare the salmon: Season fillets generously on both sides with salt and pepper. To a large nonstick skillet set over medium-high heat add oil. When oil is shimmering add the salmon fillets flesh side down and sear on both sides until nicely browned and the flesh is no longer translucent in the thickest part of the fillet 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove salmon from skillet and place on a large plate; tent with foil to keep warm while you prepare the sauce. To prepare the sauce: In a small saucepan combine wine vinegar shallots and peppercorns; cook until nearly dry. You should have about 1 tablespoon of liquid. Cool the reduction to room temperature then strain through a fine mesh sieve into a medium heatproof bowl and combine with the saffron water. To prepare the egg mixture: To a medium saucepan add water to reach 2 inches and bring to a simmer. Add egg yolks to the bowl with the reduction and place the bowl over the simmering water whisking constantly. To avoid overcooking the mixture be sure that the water is barely simmering with no visible signs of surface action just steam rising. As the egg yolks warm they increase in volume. If they become too warm and begin to coagulate around the sides and bottom remove from heat and cool slightly.To prepare the hollandaise: When the yolks have tripled in volume and the mixture thickly coats the back of a spoon after about 5 minutes remove the bowl from the simmering water. Stabilize the bowl and begin adding the melted butter in a slow thin stream whisking constantly as it is incorporated. The sauce will begin to thicken as more butter is added. When the hollandaise is thick velvety and coats the back of a spoon add the lemon juice and taste and adjust seasoning with salt and additional lemon juice as needed. If too thick add a little warm water to thin the consistency.If the sauce starts to break: It could be one of two things: either the butter was added too quickly or the egg mixture got too hot (scrambled eggs). To rescue a broken sauce try adding a small amount of boiling water and whisking until the sauce is smooth before adding more butter or add another egg yolk to a clean bowl and set back over simmering water; whisk until thickened and using a fine mesh strainer to catch the scrambled egg slowly strain the broken hollandaise gradually into the new egg yolk.To serve: Place each salmon fillet on a warmed dinner plate and spoon hollandaise on top of each portion. Garnish with minced chives and serve immediately.
By Le Creuset adapted by Kristan Raines,Home /Recipes/Breads/Yeast Breads/Olive Bread/,Olive Bread,Not specified,4 cups (550g) all purpose or bread flour  1 teaspoon (7g) kosher salt or coarse sea salt  1 teaspoon (4g) instant yeast  1 1/2 cups (360g) warm water (between 90°F-100°F)   1 cup kalamata olives patted dry and roughly chopped  Olive or vegetable oil ,Whisk together the flour salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer or large mixing bowl. Add the water and stir on low speed with the dough hook attachment for about 1 minute (or stir with a spatula). Increase speed to medium and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic about 8-10 minutes (or alternately knead by hand). Every few minutes stop the mixer and scrape the dough off the hook and sides of the bowl. When the dough appears smooth cut off a small piece and stretch it. If it stretches to the point of transparency it’s kneaded enough. If not continue kneading.Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and cover it with a damp cloth and let rest for 30 minutes. Uncover the dough add the olives and mix on low until the olives are just incorporated.Cover the dough again with a pot lid or plastic wrap and allow it to rise until it has doubled in size and does not spring back when you push your finger into it about 1 1/2 ― 2 hours (less if it’s hot and humid more if it’s cold).Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead about 1-2 minutes to release the gas. Shape the dough roughly into a ball cover with a clean towel and let rest for 10 minutes.Cup your hands around the dough and shape it into a tight ball by rolling it on the work surface between your palms. Lightly brush the base of the Bread Oven with oil. Place the dough in the center of the base and cover with the lid. Allow the dough to rise again until roughly doubled in size and when poked with a finger will slowly spring back about 30-60 minutes.During the last 15 minutes of rising time preheat oven to 450°F. When ready to bake score the bread with a sharp knife or razor making an X or a hash mark to allow the dough to expand freely. Cover and place in the hot oven.Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid reduce the oven temperature to 375°F and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes until the bread is golden brown and cooked through. It should have an internal temperature of approximately 200°F when done. Carefully remove the bread from the base and allow to cool on a rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing.
