1. A BorderPane allows us to set our images to a certain position on the stage.
Meaning we can allocate the center to FlowPanes, the sides to VBox's, and the top and bottom for HBoxs.
But in reality any sort of Pane or Box could be used, the BorderPane just allows us to organize it.

2. The compiler throws us this error: 
PaneExperiment.java:121: error: incompatible types: Object cannot be converted to Node 
I assume this happens because what we created is type object and not type node.
