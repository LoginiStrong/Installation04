What do you observe about the time it takes to do the calculations iteratively compared to recursively?:
   The iterative calculations are actually quicker than the calculations done with recursion.
   
What is your explanation?  You should gain some insight from the tree you drew in class.
It is more than just the time it takes to create the stack of methods!:
   My explanation is that the recursion method has to open multiple methods and then perform its main action,
only to then have to exit eac of the inner methods until it can return what it needs to into the main. That's what
makes it slower, rather than faster like the iterative. The iterative just calls the method once and closes it.
